             <h2> My Mom GETTING PUPPIESSS</h2>
             <p> TODAY I FOUND OUT MY MOM GETTING <em>3</em> NEW PUPPIES THEY ARE SMALL DOGSSS. But only thing is 1 is for my aunt and the other two <b>ARE MY MOMS</b> but Im the one who gotta look after them <i>sigh</i> But I do gotta say they are pretty cute if only they where a bit bigger.
<br/> I love dogs and probably gonna help at least potty train them so that gonna be interesting to say the least.<q>Potty By myself???</q> i said But over all as long as i don't step in <del>poop</del> im fine lol. But I feel like being in online and all would be a good experience.
<br/> But most importantly I do say watching them grow would be a good thing and try and get these old cats to come around and not be a meanie to them. As they might be around the same size as each other and so. And I hope they have cute personalities and all</p>
